## How to Use the Fixed Version

1. Update environment variables in `.env`:

   - Set DATABASE_URL for MongoDB connection

2. Initialize the database:
   ```
   npm run init-db
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application:

## Additional Information

The key improvement is the end-to-end integration of:
1. Company selection
2. Insurance type selection
3. AI-driven data collection using DeepSeek LLM
4. Dynamic quote calculation based on insurance type configuration
5. User-friendly display of quote details

The system now correctly handles the full flow from selecting a company and insurance type, to interacting with the AI to provide personal details, to receiving a tailored quote with appropriate price adjustments.
